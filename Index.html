      <p>
        My dream job is to become a computer scientist. I always enjoy working with computers, playing on I-pads, and high tech equipment such as Virtual Reality. I also enjoy solving challenging math problems and puzzles because they put my brain to work.

      I love video games. I love them because they can realive my stress, be really fun to play, and because you can play with family or friends to create a bond. I love playing Star Wars Battle Front. This game is based off of the movie series Star Wars.

      <a id="hockey"></a> I love hockey. It has been my favorite sport since I started skating at 3 years old. I play on the Chicago Bulldogs AA Central States hockey team. Our practices are at Heartland Ice arena at Lincolnwood. This rink is also the home of the Chicago Young Americans.
